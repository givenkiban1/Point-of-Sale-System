Hi there, welcome to the Customer Membership System (CMS) of UMBILO PLAZZA. We are delighted
that you are using this our software because we have created especially for you.

The reason why we created the CMS was so that we can keep track of our most
loyal customers and so that we can reward them with gifts(discounts) or even additional money.

In our CMS, we use Loyalty Points (LP) as a currency, R1 = 0.9 LPs. 
Despite how much greater our LP currency is compared to the Rand, we constantly give
you more LP's for each purchase that you make and give you more discounts.
 
Therefore this is a quality currency and we advise each and every of our customer to 
make use of it because it is valuable and rich in rewards.

The CMS has been introduced by Given Kibanza - under the alias of his company GinTec, a senior student from Brettonwood High School
whom is very passionate about computer science and using technology to make the world
a better place. By the way, Given is my nephew.
