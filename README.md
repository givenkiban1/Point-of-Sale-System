# Point-of-Sale-System
This was my Grade 12(High School) final project for IT. I created a Point of sale system. Pretty functional. We were being taught in Pascal (Delphi). This was in  2018


To open this project, you need to install Delphi 7 or Delphi 10. Might not be compatible with Delphi 12+

To run this project, you need to launch on the '.exe' file. 

Only works on windows.
